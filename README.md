# Unifire
Unifire is a free and public project that I developed in Ruby during my holiday. This project aims to simplify and enhance integration for users with varying levels of computer knowledge.
Unifire is user-friendly enough for individual users, yet powerful enough to meet the needs of enterprise organizations. It is especially designed for users in countries that use right-to-left languages. The project includes many cool features that have been added over time, but for now, it remains quite simple.
I invite you to join my project and share your ideas to help improve it! Feel free to modify any part of it further to better match your style!
